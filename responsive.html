            <p>For this assignment, I implemented CSS Flex and Grid techniques to create a responsive layout for a mockup landing page. The process began by carefully examining the HTML structure in the browser, identifying the various components and layouts within the code. To arrange the elements, I utilized the power of Flex and Grid, referring to the HTML and CSS concepts covered in the course for guidance and inspiration.</p>

                <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
                <p>Aside from learning and refreshing my skills on grid layout and responsive design, I also learned about efficient coding. Working together with Henry Navntoft on this assignment, he showed me tips and tricks that I had yet to see or hear of, which sped up my coding process and streamlined how I made it responsive.</p>
